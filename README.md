# Task Management / Project Coordination System

This is an in-progress application which is to be developed into a Task Management / Project Team Coordination system for ease of communication between the project head and the team. This aims to be used for both freelancing teams and formal organizations for actions like

1. Assign tasks with details and deadlines
2. Schedule meetings on an inbuilt calendar 
3. A chat-room for sending and recieving memos, notes etc
4. A file system for storing Minutes of Meeting, project documents etc

It aims to be an all in one dashboard with the daily project/office tasks spread out in a minimalistic and clean UI to be legible and neat.
